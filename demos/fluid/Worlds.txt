World5 compared to World4:
There is actually no need to update the nodes_data array, we can simply upload the nodes_pos array directly to GPU.

World6 compared to World5:
Simplified, inlined physics math

World7 compared to World6:
- xs and ys stored separately, consequently. Attrib changed: x and y input is split now
- xs and ys allocation is 32-bytes aligned
- intrinsics (AVX) for 256-bit (8-float) operations: 5x speedup of the loop!
