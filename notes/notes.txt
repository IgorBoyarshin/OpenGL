glfwGetTime() --- seconds since glfwInit()



Later: take Material instead of Shader.
Shader + Uniforms = Material.
By binding a material it binds shader and its uniforms

// GL_UNSIGNED_INT must be the same type as in IBO
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, ibo.GetCount(), GL_UNSIGNED_INT, nullptr);



By default, without any matrix transformations, OpenGL has the Z-axis (ranging -1..+1) pointing towards the screen, away from us.
Thus, objects with lower z-value will be in front of those with larger z-value, and thus closer and so visible to us.

On the other hand, orthographic projection maps the z-axis in the opposite direction (pointing from the screen towards us).


==== stb_image.h usage ====
Function stbi_load returns an array that has (rgb) tripplets row-by-row, top-to-bottom
